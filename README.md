This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks for FOSS4G 2022 workshop.

## Abstract
Whether you are considering using GRASS GIS for your next project or you are a GRASS GIS power user who wants to learn new tips and tricks, this workshop is for you. We will explain and practice GRASS GIS concepts like location, computational region, or mask and demonstrate them on examples of efficient raster, vector, and imagery processing. We will go through several options to parallelize your workflows that are applicable for various computing platforms including your laptop and HPC. Finally, this workshop will be run in a JupyterLab environment, taking advantage of the latest GRASS GIS Python features for Jupyter, including pretty 2D, 3D, webmap, and temporal visualizations.
